# SetupCraft
An installer for making packages you have developed distributable. Is supposed to be simple to use.

> Note: This project is in a very early stage. The codebase and build are works-in-progress.

Prebuilt binaries (for quick testing) are included in the `SetupCraft` directory of this repository — you can download or run those if you want to try the current build without compiling locally.
