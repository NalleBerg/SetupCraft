This folder is a placeholder for SQLite3 headers and DLLs required by the example project.

Action items:
- Copy the full SQLite3 headers (sqlite3.h, sqlite3ext.h, etc.) into this folder if you want the example to build with SQLite support.
- Place the MinGW-built `sqlite3.dll` (or other needed runtime DLLs) into `mingw_dlls\` or alongside the built executable.

You can copy the headers from the existing project in `..\\WinProgramManager\\sqlite3` if desired.
